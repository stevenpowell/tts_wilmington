# Another great example is at http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm

size = 10

size.times do

	#do some things 'size' times

end

my_array = [1,2,3,4]

my_array.each do |x|

	# go over each item in my_array
	# and let 'x' be the current item

end

array_1 = [1,2,3]
array_2 = [4,5,6]

for i in 0...array_1.length

	# 'i' is just a counter but you can use it to access different arrays
	# or keep track of how many times you looped

	#sum.push(array_1[i] + array_2[i])

end

count = 0
max = 10
while count < max #also could use an 'until'

	# do something while (or until a contition is true)
	# does not neceesarily need to be counting

end
